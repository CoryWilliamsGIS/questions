<h2>Creating a New Question: </h2>
<text area>
•	Locate the question form at the bottom of the application screen.
<p>
•	Populate each field of the question form, indicating the correct answer with the check buttons below. Unless you know the exact desired coordinates, leave the location fields blank for now.
<p>
•	To choose the location of the question, click the desired position on the map. This will automatically populate the Latitude and Longitude fields with the appropriate coordinates. 
<p>
•	If the desired location is not visible on the map, you can navigate to it using the following techniques:
<p>
1 -	To move / pan the map, click and drag the mouse to a new location.
<p>
2 - To zoom in/out of the map, either use the zoom button in the bottom left corner of the map or use the scroll function on the mouse or trackpad of your machine.
<p>
•	Once all fields are populated, click the ‘Submit Question’ button to upload the information to the database. If successful, you will be alerted!
<p>
•	If the user has not filled in all fields of the form, you will also be alerted.
<p>
•	To make another question, click the ‘Clear Form’ button to remove all existing values in the form. 
<p>
•	Repeat the above process.
<p>
<p>
<h2>Displaying Existing Questions: </h2>
<p>
•	Clicking the ‘Show Questions’ button will display any existing questions as orange markers.
<p>
•	It is advised to do this after every successful question submission to ensure the location is as intended.
<p>
•	Clicking the question markers on the map will display the information inserted in the ‘Location Name’ and ‘Question’ fields of the form upon creation
<p>
<p>
<h2>Server Related Errors: </h2>
<p>
•	If the user clicks the ‘Show Questions’ button and no orange markers are loaded on the map, it can be for two reasons:
<p>
1-	There are not any questions in the database to add to the map.
<p>
2-	The httpServer is not running.
<p>
•	If any of the above occur, cancel and restart each server and the web application should work as expected.
<p>
<p>
<h2>Additional Notes: </h2>
<p>
•	Currently, the web application does not support deleting or editing of questions.
